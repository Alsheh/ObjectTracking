# Object Tracking
Track an object and find its color range automatically.

This application can be used to track an object in a video or a live feed from a camera after completing the automatic color range calibration step.

After running the application, select the the region in which the object you want to track. Look at the second window which should show the color of the detected object. Once you're satisfied with the detected color range, you may press the "s" key to save the color range and object tracking will start.
